# FoodEX


This is a web platform designed to help farmers directly sell their products or crop harvests from their farms. With a focus on empowering farmers and providing a seamless connection between producers and buyers, FoodEX aims to bridge the gap in the global food export market. By leveraging a user-friendly HTML-based website, FoodEX enables farmers to showcase their fresh produce and sell it globally, eliminating middlemen and ensuring fair prices for both parties.

The project aspires to contribute to a more sustainable and direct food trade system, bringing local harvests to the international market with ease.
